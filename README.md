# CAR SALES DASHBOARD 

# ABOUT 
This project focuses on analyzing car sales data for various dealerships. The dataset contains information about each car sold, including the car's ID, sale date, customer name, gender, annual income of the customer, dealership name, car details (company, model, engine type, transmission, color, price), dealership contact details (dealer number, body style, phone number, region), and the date of the data.

The analysis aims to uncover insights into the sales patterns, customer demographics, and dealership performance. By exploring this dataset, we can understand the preferences of customers, the popularity of different car models, and the effectiveness of dealership strategies. This information can be valuable for dealerships in optimizing their sales and marketing efforts to better serve their customers and improve their business performance.
